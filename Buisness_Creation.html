					<h2>GoldenTix</h2>
					<h4>How did this start?</h4>
					<p> This business was created in my Innovation and Entrepreneurship 1 class, through a semester long project. We had to come up with a sales pitch for it, create all the financial documents, and ended up making the software.</p>
					<h4>What is GoldenTix?</h4>
					<p>GoldenTix is an automated 50/50 ticket that runs off tablets, you fill in all of the information the business wants, then select your tick package, then all of your ticket numbers are printed out. This software was an affordable option for smaller venues to have this kind of automated 50/50 ticket system to make it easier and more effective on the walkers. This software is fully customizable to each venues preferences such as the information collected, the color, ticket package, and even a live display option. This was going to be placed into Clarkson University Hockey games, but covid has placed a hurdle in the way as on now, due to social distancing.</p>
					<h4>What are the take a ways?</h4>
					<p>From this I learned how to create important financial documents in excel, while keeping track of cost, and accounts. I was able to gain experience using WordPress, to create a website which is currently on lockdown until we know what is going to happen with it after the pandemic. I learned how to create a sales presentation, pitch to investors, and give a live demonstration of the software during it. One of the biggest take a ways wis the ability to function efficiently working in a team.</p>
